 ## Future
 This project was built 2 years ago. Its only purpose now is to show off my flutter skills. I was planning on releasing it during Covid as a side to online education but then MS Teams suddenly exploded in popularity and I cant really compete with Microsoft over anything lol. Hence i dropped the project. Will be adding more features down the road. Stay tuned! Hit me up if you want to collaborate
